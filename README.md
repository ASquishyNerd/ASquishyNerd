### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm ASquishyNerd but most people just call me Squishy or Ed. I decided to create this github to add some of my projects to.

## A bit about me
I graduated from college in May of 2020 and got my bachelors in cyber security & forensics. I participated in PRCCDC and ICCDI at highline college I had a great time setting up those competitions and working with everyone. I was also apart of the cyber competition club and was able to compete as part of a blue team back in 2019. I'm really interested in cyber security on both side but I find red teaming the most fun.

## What I'm currently learning
I'm always interested in learning new things and im always starting new projects. Latley i've been really interested in learning about binary exploitation which required me to learn more about C/C++ and x86 assembly.I've also been activley practicing on HackTheBox and have learned a lot about pentration testing and it's different phases. I plan on getting my OSCP Certification at some point this year. I've also been learning more about python as I want to become more proficient in it.
